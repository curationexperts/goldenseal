    This collection consists of 85 transcriptions of selected interviews filmed by Blackside, Inc. for America's War on Poverty documentary series that premiered January 16, 1995 on PBS. The transcripts are retrospective accounts of events that took place after President Lyndon Johnson chose to focus on poverty by declaring an "unconditional war on poverty," and launched a series of initiatives designed to end poverty forever, not through welfare or job creation, but by expanding opportunities for the poor through education and training.

  <p>
      Washington University Film &amp; Media Archive created the transcriptions from digitized videos of the interviews filmed by Blackside, Inc. and supervised the editing using Oxygen XML Developer. Grammatical errors made by speaker were left alone.
  </p> 
  <p>
      Although these files represent transcriptions of speech, they have been encoded with the Tag Set for Drama, instead of Transcriptions of Speech.
  </p> 
  <p>
      The rationale for this decision was that the more formal character of the interview had a structure closer to the drama than the speech tag set, and for ease of delivery of XML.

    In the late '60s, I was working in a Franciscan parish in Stockton, St. Mary's. It was a skidrow and farm labor and, bogs-tracked, mostly black settlement, parish. The CRLA [California Rural Legal Assistance] attorneys were starting to reconnoiteur around for-

        When CRLA was looking around for community resources, I was a priest at the parish of St. Mary's in Stockton, which is a very poor urban parish, with a lot of farm-workers and a lot of outlying areas that we served. For example, the Bracero camps of the past period had, you know, many Mexican guys that would come to church services that we would conduct for them. Father Mark Day and I—Mark, of course, later joined Cesar Chavez full-time—we had a card-file of Bracero camps and how to find them—and some of them were very hard to find because the rural roads, out in the Delta, for example, you have to cross ferries, and not all these things are sign-posted, or even known about to outsiders. So, anyway, it was a very vital resource to have that card-file, and they wanted me to help them learn where the Bracero camps were, and that's the way I met, I believe, first Ralph Segura. It was in the fall of, I guess '67, that he came to Stockton, and just ran into me by accident, after some months of having known what the, what the card file was about. And I told him that just that day, by coincidence, I had been out picking tomatoes in a large farm near Tracy, with my little sister, who was underage, and very healthy, but she wasn't—

      At that time, I was a Franciscan priest in the parish of St. Mary's in Stockton, which was responsible for a lot of the farmland around Stockton. And Father Mark Day and I were special pastors, as it were, of the farm-labor population—people mostly from Mexico, many of whom lived in outlying areas, in, in camps and barracks, and what were called Bracero camps, farm-worker camps. We had church services, Mass for these workers, and maps of how to find these places, so the CRLA people were really delighted by this. I got to know them a little bit, thought it was quite an interesting program. And late that fall, Ralph Segura and I happened into each other right when he was work --

    <p>   
      The way I first got to know the CRLA program was because I was approached as a possible resource for the CRLA attorneys. I was working as a Franciscan priest in St. Mary's parish, Stockton, and that parish has a large part of responsibility for the farmworkers all over the San Joaquin County area. Most of these workers were Spanish-speaking, from Mexico, and they required Masses in Spanish, and Father Mark Day and I would go out to these very remote little places that you wouldn't think were settlements. We know the route, we knew the roads to the places, we knew, names of people in charge of the farm-labor camps, and that sort of thing. So CRLA was really glad to get that information.

    The CRLA attorneys didn't really know Stockton very well. They knew farm-work, and had a goal, but they didn't know particular community information like locale of the settlements, the leaders, the people who could be trusted, and, and that sort of thing, and it was a natural relationship there, between the attorneys and people like Mark and myself.

        The farmers, large farmers, particularly, in Stockton area, had the plan of bringing additional workers from Mexico who were more easily controlled, and by scheduling, and by age, and so forth—those were called braceros, usually young men who were very hard workers and didn't need maintenance, family lives, or even need, didn't need to be around in the winter-time, and so forth. The workers—the growers, rather—had the approval of the government to bring in these workers, if they, the growers, that is, met certain conditions for how they were treating the local workers. And so CRLA was concerned that the conditions were being violated, and that the workers from Mexico were being added on to this labor force, causing harm for everybody. As a matter of fact, it was very easy for me to say that the conditions were being violated because of the everyday reality of the fields. Supposedly—this was a big surprise to me—supposedly the farmers were supposed to have toilets if they were to earn right [sic] to use Mexican, additional bracero workers, and there were no toilets in the field. There were no protections for the children working in the field, for the women, against indignity and excessive lifting—that was part of the California law, then, that women couldn't lift more than twenty-five pounds.

    <sp>
      <speaker n="interviewee">LORENZO AVILA:</speaker> 
      <p>
        Yes. Well, the first thing was to get additional people, principally the CRLA community workers, to go out with me, or in my direction, on farm-work jobs, usually in the buses—large school-type buses, old rackety [sic], you know, broken-down school buses that were used for farm-work. And those would go out to these farm sites, and carry out work. And we tried to place our people, our witnesses, at the particular growers. This was not always very easy, because you had to know which farm labor contractor was working for a particular grower, which farm labor contractor uses colored buses and names that were on the sides, but sometimes they would sub-contract; and so we had to chase around to find work going on that we could observe and document was violating the conditions set forth by the government.

          One of the ways we tried to help the attorneys in the documentation of the practices in the farms that would disqualify the use of braceros, was, to try to take pictures of the existing situations, the lack of clean drinking water, the lack of toilets, the lack of safeguarding for children if the parents are working in the fields in any kind of dangerous or unhealthy situation. And this was really easy to do, except it would cause, since it was a very novel thing to have a camera in a, farm-work field, caused a lot of, you know, vigilance on the part of the labor contractor, the, local people who, you know, who knew that we were up to something strange.

        I don't think that we were ever in danger, but we surely did attract a retinue of, of pick-up trucks with guns hanging in the back window and such, when we were looking around for particular tomato harvesting. operations that we wanted to be vulnerable. 'Cause we would, we knew these growers were seeking to use braceros, and we knew that if they were using the industry standard, they were violating the rights of the workers.

      <speaker n="interviewee">LORENZO AVILA:</speaker> 
      <p>
        Yes. It was really important, in this view, to curtail the Bracero program, because it brought in so much [sic] extra benefits to the growers, without a corresponding bargaining increase or strength of the workers. These, Mexican guys, you remember, came in under contract for a fixed period, and they weren't supposed to come back. This was not part of the, the view of the workers or the United States government, to bring them in so they could then come back later. This was to bring them in so they could be shipped back, unless they came back as braceros another time. And this was the ultimate disposable worker. You know, a tractor you had to feed in the winter-time, you have to shelter it, you have to maintain it. Braceros? No, you know? They went home, they didn't have any responsibility—I don't know, there were some sorts of fringe benefits that I think the American government negotiated in the 40s, during the early, heavy use of braceros, but, the problem for the workers, local workers, was that

          these braceros were very dedicated workers, had nothing else on their minds, and they gave the, wage structure kind of a bottomless character for the local workers. The, local workers could not support a family, take care of United States expenses on the wages that braceros were paid, and happily took.

        It was easy for growers to cite average wages that were really quite high, and maybe could be earned by some superstar pickers, but usually when they were talking about twenty dollars an hour, or even a respectable, ten dollars an hour, they're talking about multiple people working on one Social Security number; this was a practice that was well-known. It worked to the advantage of the growers in some cases, because their paperwork and their legal, trail was obscured, and also, it seemed to help some workers. They didn't really want their children to be recorded as working, so the children would work on the parent's Social Security number. That was a problem. I think the conditions were well-known to be, difficult, quite without any fraud on the part of the growers.

        In the Franciscan parish of St. Mary's, I was one of a class of newly-graduated priests, under the guidance of Father Alan McCoy, who was extremely, social in his vision of religion, and very, very much a man of the people, and of the farmworkers in San Joaquin County. And he had been on the radio saying something which we later saw, of, the abuses by growers of the local workers. For example, St. Mary's has a park in front of it where a lot of winos would hang out in the warm afternoons, and they would sleep there. They would work in the morning and sleep in front of St. Mary's, and often, Father Alan mentioned on this talk-show once, on the radio, I think it was K-JOY, in Stockton, that the growers would take these winos out in these school-buses—

        Yes. Well, I also saw, the growers using the winos and other less-motivated American resident farm-workers as evidence that only braceros could do the job. The, the winos were cited in, in publicity from the growers, they were often, kinda stage-managed into a camera range for, some of the problems in the growers' perspective about how hard it is to earn a buck in, in farming. This was, it was abusive of the many hard-working, many Mexican, resident workers, and also, of course, it suited the, growers' intention of bringing in only the most controllable workers—that is, the braceros.

        Mostly by doc—CRLA was hoping to use my knowledge and other's, other people's, by formal declarations. We would write up our, things we had witnessed during the farm-work day in declarations, with the help of the attorneys, at night. I had never written a declaration before, except to declare myself permanently poor, and owning no property, because I was, you know, joining the Franciscans. That was as legal as life had been for me, and it was a great thing to see declarations, stating common sense reality, actually get taken, and delivered somewhere, and used. Commonplace, well-understood things were not spoken of so clearly, and not common knowledge [sic], I guess, at least in the court system, and the legal system.

        CRLA had sued the Department of Labor for having allowed the growers, improperly, to sign up for the Bracero Program—additional forty thousand workers, I think—and the declarations we filed, and various reports, were used to give rise to an injunction. I think it was a federal judge who declared the Department of Labor out of compliance with its own rules, and suspended the Bracero Program.

        The community workers were partners of the lawyers. The attorneys for the CRLA program were usually very highly-educated, young people from—many from Ivy League Schools, many from out of California—who simply didn't know the local way of doing things, and had no connections, had no language skills in the farm-worker life experience, and, needed, needed these local partners, needed what we call now 'paralegals,' right, to give them information, to teach them how to get out into the community. I think it was a natural partnership, certainly necessary.

        Lots, the community workers did lots and lots of translating, did lots of explaining to the farm-workers, and many people at that level—cannery workers, not so well-educated people—how to fill out forms. Many times simple business that didn't require a lawyer was beyond these folks because of the English, or because of the, jargon of agency forms, and community workers could often solve many, many problems by simply encouraging people, giving them a little time, a little literacy training, and things like that.

        There were lots of tensions between community workers and lawyers because, the farm-work problems had been so long-standing. There was, some resistance, in some of the communities, to belief [sic] that any team, even, of, of good young lawyers could make a difference. Certain amount of cynicism, apathy, has to be overcome. Sometimes community leaders, actually, didn't want someone to come in and take their turf, or be the leaders too much, displacing them. So, attorneys needed, in order to fit in and do a good job, they needed to learn the local community structure, and the community workers had to help them see this.

        One thing that the community workers did which was indispensable for the lawyers in the CRLA program, was, often to aid the young attorneys get acclimatized to a community [sic]. I think that Gilroy office stood out in this way. A little dusty town with not much happening except farm-work, and lot [sic] of old-time Mexican-American leaders. One of them, a guy who said he'd ridden with Pancho Villa, Antonio del Buono—Italian last name, but very Mexican guy, an old, very formal, very loveable guy—he was a community worker, and I think he was sort of a grandfather image to many of these lawyers, and certainly was an able public speaker and leader in the Gilroy community, so he made things very much easier. He would take them around, introduce them, These are my boys, and, and it got off to a very good start there. Others [sic] offices were different. They had many more attorneys with their own strong views, and because of their case agenda, sometimes they would look for little bits of information. This was a very, valid approach, but it's not the same as going into the community, learning the issues, and letting something rise from the grassroots.

        And yet sometimes there were tensions. You mentioned [Miles? Pineida]. Could you represent some, what that tension was about?

        The community workers felt that the spotlight was always on the attorneys. The attorneys were filing these important briefs, going on camera at the local news, and such, and they didn't see the credit going—they didn't have, maybe, in all cases, the vision of the attorneys of how to use publicity, and how this is part of the whole necessary change. Sometimes the community workers wanted a greater sense of solidarity among each other, and there was only one or two in any one CRLA office. Naturally attorneys confer a lot. Well, the community workers wanted to confer a lot, and generate their own consciousness base and their own power base. And this was something that developed over time.

        When I was first, working with CRLA—I was not a CRLA employee—I didn't know much about the relationship between the Farm-Workers Organizing Committee and CRLA, didn't really know—they were two new entities anyway. The following year, when I was working for CRLA, I learned that we were to be very careful about contacting Cesar's people, and generally didn't. We were very careful not to be involved with that, because there were a lot of people around California watching us like hawks, to try to violate, try to detect CRLA violating the conditions of its anti-poverty funding. So, in '67, '69, I don't think there was much contact between those two groups, certainly not between the leaders. There were some people, like Mark Day, who worked vigorously for both.

        I learned from CRLA a lot of what I had not previously learned about, just plain good governance and democracy, because the theme emphasized so much in CRLA is, give these farm-workers a stake through informed consent, through knowledge of what is the law, and what it, it not only should be, but it is. And since literacy was a problem, since education's a problem, whether the law was proposed or real made very little difference to most workers. And therefore, to even tell them, you have rights, you don't have to change anything to have these rights—this was, this was big news to a lot of farm-worker advocates—lot of, sort of, self-appointed social workers, like myself, and it made for a burst of energy which, I think, is still with us, I hope so, in many ways, about trying to make the system work.

        I met up with CRLA first in Stockton, California, where I was a, kind of a, just-out-of-seminary assistant pastor in St. Mary's parish. St. Mary's had a large part of southern Stockton, a lot of poor people, and a lot of the outlying area in parish [sic], especially out in the farming areas, where Mexican workers lived in little settlements, in barracks and so forth. And they were located in hard-to-find places, and so we had at the St. Mary's rectory, a card-file of how to get to these various places to have Mass for the workers. And Father Mark Day and I would do the circuit of places and have services, and, and, do what we could to help on quick visits. I was introduced to CRLA through some other, I think anti-poverty type people, and gave them a look at this card-file, and they were really quite delighted, and then they took copies of much of it, and then I didn't hear from them for some time. But a few months later, the first of the bracero investigations took place, and we were very active.
