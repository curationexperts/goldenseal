<display>The James E. and Joan Singer Schiele Print Collection,
1848-1876, consists of Civil War prints and other historical images. The
prints include portraits, battle scenes, and political cartoons representing
avariety of printing techniques from woodcut to chromolithograph. A highlight
of the collection is a set of thirty-six Kurz &amp; Allison prints. The
entire collection consists of over 160 artistic pieces.These prints make up
a visual overview of historical events during one of the nation's most
tumultuous times, and provide a strong background for cultural and historical
studies. The prints are arranged by James E. Schiele and divided into seven
series: Series 01: Kurz &amp; Allison, Series 02: Antebellum, Series 03:
Civil War, Series 04: Slavery and Abolition, Series 05: Emancipation and
Reconstruction, Series 06: Postbellum, Series 07: Print Material.
Biographical Note: A native St. Louisan and active community volunteer,
James Schiele, AB '52, MLA '85, acquired over several decades the historic
images that constitute the Schiele Collection. He and his wife, Joan Singer
Schiele, donated the collection to University Libraries and established
an endowment to help support conservation and expansion of the
collection. Fueled by his enthusiasm, Schiele has committed countless years
to serving Washington University through membership on the Alumni Board
of Governors, the Eliot Society Membership Committee, the W Club
Executive Committee, his Class Reunion Committee, the International
Advisory Council for Asia, the Scholars in Arts &amp; Sciences, and as a
member of the Murray Wiedenbaum Center on the Economy, Government, and
Public Policy.</display>
